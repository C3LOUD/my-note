### Archive chat to note
```text
Based on everything we've discussed so far in this chat, please generate a structured markdown note in this format:

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
### Title with H3
- Bullet point for each atomic knowledge
#### Subtitle with H4 (if needed)
- More detail or grouped bullet under the H4
##### H5 (very rarely used)
- Specific deeper layer if necessary

Each bullet should be:
- Atomic (standalone)
- Clear and precise
- Useful as a long-term knowledge reference
```
