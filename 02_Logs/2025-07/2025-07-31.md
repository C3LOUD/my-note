## 📚 What I Learned
### Misc
### V8, Browser and Node
- V8 is an engine that parse, interpret and compile javascript code
- Browser is a platform full of feature, but mostly provide web api for V8 to call and it's also include the runtime but not only the runtime
- Node is a runtime, that have node api for v8 to call
- V8 is written in C++, after compiling javascript code, it find reference in the memory
- Node and browser is built into binary, when it start, it loads the apis and relevant things into memory, so that V8 can find the reference and use the pointer to trigger it
### CPU architecture
- Cpu directly load 0s and 1s as high low voltage
- The hardware logic gate handle how the instruction should pass
- Cpu loads the chunk of binary and that 0s and 1s represent instruction
- Cpu runs cycle between, FETCH, DECODE and EXECUTE
- The program counter tells cpu where to fetch the next instruction
- The instruction fetch from memory and pass to instruction register
